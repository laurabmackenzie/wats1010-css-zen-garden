For my Zen Garden, I've chosen a "spa" theme. I've chosen a header photo that will convey a calming relaxed theme and include some visuals like a rolled up towel, rocks, and candles to add to the spa feel. I'm going to use varying shades of gray for the backgrounds with darker shades toward the bottom to anchor it and blend into the footer photo, which is a very dark photo with water, lilypads and branches. I want to make the user feel that this is a stress-free, calming place to relax.

I feel like although this isn't a super original layout, it does follow the basic design principles of having the most imporant information on the top left, and having the sidebar materials on the right, and less important information toward the bottom. So users should know what to expect. On the portions with darker backgrounds, I'll use white text and darker text with the lighter backgrounds, so all the text is readable. I feel the the layout also has some nice symmetry with a photo at the top and bottom. Lines separate the separate sections for clarity.

I want to use the rocks from the header photo as bullets for the headlines in the main content, and a lilypad from the footer photo and place it in the sidebar. I feel like this makes the page more cohesive.

I liked the use of bullets in this version:
